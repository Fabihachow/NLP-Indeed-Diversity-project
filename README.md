# NLP-Indeed-Diversity-project
Diversity is very important to include in a company.
In this particular project we will be able to see how many companies actually mentions it in their Company description on [Indeed](https://ca.indeed.com/).

## How do we find this out?

Well as a aspiring Data Scientist, who is clearly an visible minority, I will guide you through the collection of data through API, by taking an example of searching Data Science jobs on Indeed. Then we make sure our dataset is conform for our unsupervised learning project. Going through the description, the huggingface model will help us sort through the key words we need. In the end by the help of clustering we are able to determine the companies who mentions it in their description and which do not seem to be very inclusive. Make sure to go all the way to the end to be ale to see the Cluster visualisation with Diversity.

### Thank you and have fun!
